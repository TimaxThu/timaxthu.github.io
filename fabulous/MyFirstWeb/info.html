    <p>In this post, I don't want to tell you my resume, but to tell you something about how to make a perfect resume for yourself.</p>
    <p>A good resume should pay attention to these points:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Be concise, be true to yourself. Including personal information (name/gender/age/mobile phone number/email/city of residence), work experience (company/time period/position/what you have done/achieved), educational background (school/major/time period) / education) three parts.</li>
      <li>Regarding "what you did", it should be specific to what "you" did, not the content of your work. For example, if you are a product manager, you can write the core user process that you are responsible for designing the XX applet, and grow the number of users from X to Y. But don't write that your work content is general content such as pre-market research, requirement document writing, project management, and cross-departmental communication. "Write your resume as JD" is a common mistake many people make.</li>
      <li>Regarding "what achievements have been achieved", if it is a quantifiable result, try to express it in data. If you are worried about leaking company secrets, you can use the year-on-year and month-on-month growth percentage to reflect it, which not only shows professionalism but also avoids leaking secrets.</li>
      <li>You can't be sure what operating system the interviewer and HR of the other company are using, whether it's on a computer or a mobile phone outside, so it's always safer to send a .pdf format (to avoid typographical issues).</li>
    </ol>
    <br><br>
    <p>The following began to vomit, there are four "DON'T":</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Don't apply any resume templates on the market. Writing a resume is a great opportunity to review yourself, open a blank word, let go of yourself, and write from scratch. The content is more important than the format, so there is no need to stick to the "format". Don't use the resumes downloaded from Lagou, Liepin and other websites to send to different companies. No company likes to receive such resumes, just like no one likes to be someone else's spare tire.</li>
      <li>Don't use any internet slang, colorful colors, or weird fonts and pictures. Rather be conservative in your choice of font and font size, and try to reflect a mature yet reliable side.</li>
      <li>Don't write on your resume that "I am hard-working, responsible, an exceptionally strong learner, analytical and innovative" and other vague, unproven content that has no immediate way to prove it. Whether or not you have these abilities is proven by the content and achievements of your past work, not by lip service. Never be under the illusion that having a perfect resume will increase your success in an interview.</li>
      <li>No matter how much work experience you have, your resume should never be more than 2 pages. It doesn't mean that after 10 years of work, your resume should be 5 or 6 pages. You should know that many HRs do not give more than 30 seconds of attention to a resume.</li>
    </ol>
